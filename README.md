# ðŸ§  Grinding Journey

> *"Skill is earned. Not downloaded."*

Welcome to my **Grinding Journey** â€“ a long-term commitment to becoming an elite problem solver and builder through consistent, focused practice.

This repository documents my personal journey of solving problems from platforms like LeetCode, learning computer science fundamentals, and exploring real-world implementation of algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Commitment

I commit to:

- Solving as many problems as possible, consistently and mindfully.
- Documenting my **approach, thought process, and key takeaways**.
- Writing clean, reusable code with meaningful comments.
- Reflecting on mistakes and patterns through **Feynman-style explanations**.
- Prioritizing depth of understanding over shallow speed.
