# GeeksforGeeks Journey 🚀

This repository contains my personal journey in mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **Competitive Programming (CP)**, and core **Computer Science fundamentals** through problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen my problem-solving skills in DSA and CP.
- Build consistent daily practice habits.
- Document solutions and explanations for future revision.
- Share insights and approaches that might help fellow learners.


> Each folder contains Python files (`.py`) with solutions to specific problems, organized by topic.

## 🧠 `.py` File Format

Every `.py` file includes:

- 🔹 **Problem title**
- 🔗 **Problem link (from GeeksforGeeks or similar)**
- 🧠 **1-line approach summary**
- 💡 **Status (e.g. Solved ✅ / To Revisit 🔁)**
- 💻 **Clean code with inline comments**

**Example:**
```python
