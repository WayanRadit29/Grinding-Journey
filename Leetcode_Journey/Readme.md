# 🚀 LeetCode Journey

This folder contains my ongoing solutions and notes for selected LeetCode problems.  
Each solution is written with clear logic, structured code, and Feynman-style comments to ensure deep understanding and reusability.

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Strengthen core logic and algorithmic thinking.
- Identify patterns across different problem types.
- Implement clean, efficient, and modular solutions.
- Use each problem as a tool to think, not just to solve.


## 🧩 Problem Topics Covered

| Topic                | Status        | Notes                       |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Stack & Queue       | ✅ In progress | Monotonic stack, bracket matching |
| Array & Hashing     | ⏳ In progress | Two pointers, map-based     |
| Sliding Window       | 🔜 Upcoming    |                            |
| Graph & Tree        | 🔜 Upcoming    | BFS, DFS planned            |
| Dynamic Programming | 🔜 Upcoming    | Tabulation, recursion       |

## 📌 Notes
- Comments use Feynman-style explanation: teach to understand.
- Code clarity is prioritized over "tricks".
- Every problem is an opportunity to find reusable patterns.
