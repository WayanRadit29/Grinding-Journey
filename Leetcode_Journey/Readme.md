# ðŸš€ LeetCode Journey

This folder contains my ongoing solutions and notes for selected LeetCode problems.  
Each solution is written with clear logic, structured code, and Feynman-style comments to ensure deep understanding and reusability.

## ðŸ§  Learning Focus
- Strengthen core logic and algorithmic thinking.
- Identify patterns across different problem types.
- Implement clean, efficient, and modular solutions.
- Use each problem as a tool to think, not just to solve.
